# Welcome to LearnPlasma!

If you ended up here, you’re probably interested in learning about Plasma, a framework for building scalable decentralized applications.

We started LearnPlasma because the existing information about Plasma is spread all over the place. We wanted to gather all of that information in a single place and make it much easier for someone to browse. At the same time, we found that there simply isn’t enough easy-to-understand learning material about Plasma. We started writing our own material and eventually we ended up here!

# Contributing

LearnPlasma is a community effort and a labor of love! The project was started at the 2018 IC3-Ethereum Crypto Boot Camp at Cornell University. Most of the content on this website was contributed by people who didn’t know anything about Plasma coming into the boot camp.

You can become a contributor to LearnPlasma! There’s always lots to be done. This entire website is open source and available at the LearnPlasma GitHub repository. Please open a GitHub issue if you’re confused about something, want to ask a question, or have any general feedback! Want to see content about a specific topic? Open an issue! If you’re unfamiliar with GitHub, we’ve created a simple guide to opening your first issue here. We also appreciate any pull requests with bug reports, typos, or new content.

If you want to contribute code to a Plasma project, we’re maintaining a list of actively developed Plasma implementations and ecosystem projects here. You can learn about the current open research questions and see a list of ways you can contribute here.

# Community
Learning alone is no fun! To make the learning process as collaborative as possible, we’ve launched the LearnPlasma reddit community. There you’ll be able to ask questions and discuss different Plasma-related topics with other people also learning more about Plasma. You can also tweet at the LearnPlasma Twitter account if you’d like to.

We're looking for subreddit moderators! Feel free to reach out to any of the current moderators if you'd like to help out.

# Non-technical explanation

Blockchains are very useful because they allow peers to safely interact with one another, without the need for any sort of central authority. In a decentralised system, like a blockchain, there is no central computer or central storage system. Instead, every piece of information, in relation to the blockchain’s operation, has to be instantly published and then stored separately by each peer.

This, and other factors, limit the scalability of blockchain systems, and as such, blockchains can only process a handful of transactions per second. As a result, what’s known as, second layer scaling solutions are being researched and developed. These second layer solutions, like Plasma, can be created independently and then run on-top of the blockchain.

As we just mentioned, decentralised systems require that everybody stores everything. But what if you wanted to pay for video streaming by the minute or wanted to set up a reoccurring transaction to your local coffee shop. In light of current blockchain scaling reality, does everybody really need to know about all of your everyday micro purchases in real-time?

Second layer solutions allow you to take transactions off the blockchain, whilst still enjoying the safe operation and security offered by the core blockchain system. Put simply, Plasma aims to provide exponentially higher transaction throughput for you, whilst guaranteeing safety and security. Wait ... this sounds like magic! How is this achieved?

There are quite a few cryptography functions and crypto-economic mechanisms which can help with this. There are a lot of active researchers and developers in this space, and as such there are a lot of new and exciting Plasma designs. It may evenutally be the case that different types of Plasma implementations will better serve different types of situations. We have already seen a few different designs such as Minimal Viable Plasma, Plasma Cash, Plasma Debit, More Viable Plasma and so forth.

An important thing to remember is that Plasma is not a product per se. Plasma could perhaps be better described as an abstract idea, or proposal, which has since spurred a lot of interest in taking blockchain scaling to a whole new level. As mentioned, researchers are working on Plasma design patterns. Once these theoretical designs have advanced, they can be coded up in a variety of ways. From this point the code can be tested on private blockchain networks, then public blockchain test networks. After rigourous research, development and testing, the creators of these and other Plasma-style scaling solutions will make them available to you, in a production setting. For example, on Ethereum's public blockchain network.
