# What is Plasma?

Plasma is, in essence, blockchains built on top of blockchains. It is a series of smart contracts that run on top of the root chain (eg. the main Ethereum blockchain).


# How does Plasma work?

These Plasma smart contracts are incentivized to continue operation autonomously via network transaction fees, which is ultimately reliant upon the underlying blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) to enforce transactional state transitions.

# How can I contribute to Plasma?

Calling all developers and content creators!

Get paid to contribute by [claiming bounties on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/profile/ethsociety).

# What is finality?

Finality, in very loose terms, means that once a particular operation has been done, it will forever be etched in history and nothing can revert that operation.

# How does Plasma get its finality?

The finality and security of Plasma depend completely on Ethereum’s i.e. the root chain’s security. Plasma works only if Ethereum is safe and secure.

# How can I create Plasma-powered dapps?

Here is where we would include instructions on how to get started building layer 2 dapps.

We can give a link to the documentation on learn Plasma by example as well as providing a link to the Github repository and readme tutorial.

# How can I report bugs?

Found a bug? [Post it to Github](http://www.learnplasma.org/pages/misc.html#contributing)!

When posting an issue on Github, please provide a thorough explanation and step-by-step instructions on how to recreate the bug.
