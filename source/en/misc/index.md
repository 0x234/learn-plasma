### Making GitHub Issues
If you’re not familiar with GitHub, this is the place for you.
All of the resources on this website are available publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/ethsociety/plasma-website).
GitHub is basically a website that allows people to store code online.
Whenever we make changes to this website, we’re really updating the published code!
This means you can see all of the content that makes up this website.
It also means you can help add content!

A fundamental feature of GitHub is the ability to create new threads called "issues."
Basically, this is a way for anyone (including you!) to request new features, report bugs, or give general feedback.
For example, you can open a new issue if you spot a typo somewhere on the website!
Your issues help us make this website better.
We want to make sure things are as clear as possible.
If there’s something you don’t understand, we want to know!

You’ll want to make a GitHub account if you don’t have one already ([click here](https://github.com/join)).
If you’d like to make your first issue, start by heading over to the [LearnPlasma GitHub page](https://github.com/ethsociety/plasma-website).
You should see something like this:

![github3](/img/misc/github/github3.png)
<br><br>

Now, you’ll want to click on the tab titled "Issues." If you can’t find the tab, you can get to the issues page directly by heading to this link:
[https://github.com/ethsociety/plasma-website/issues](https://github.com/ethsociety/plasma-website/issues).

You should be on this page:

![github2](/img/misc/github/github2.png)
<br><br>

Click the green "New issue" button and you’ll end up on a page with a form where you can describe your issue:

![github3](/img/misc/github/github3.png)
<br><br>

This form has room for two main components, the issue title and the issue body.
The issue title is the summary of your issue that other people will see on the "Issues" page.
You should try to keep this title as short and clear as possible!
Something short like "Typo on the home page" or "Requesting more content about Plasma Cash" quickly lets us know how to help.

The issue body is the main content of your issue.
Here, you’ll want to fill in any relevant information to the issue at hand.
If you spot a typo, a link to the page with the typo would be much appreciated.
If you’re requesting new content or you find something confusing, a summary of what’s unclear makes it easier to put out better content.

Once you’ve filled in the relevant information, hit the "Submit new issue" button and you’re done!
You’ve just submitted your first GitHub issue.
Hopefully this helped - if you’re still stuck you can make a post on the [LearnPlasma subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/learnplasma), tweet at the [LearnPlasma Twitter account](https://twitter.com/learnplasma), or shoot us an email at [contact@learnplasma.org](mailto:contact@learnplasma.org?Subject=GitHub%20Help).
