            <!-- General Research -->
            <h2 id="general">General Research</h2>
            <p>
              Lots of research goes into making Plasma better in general!
              This section contains broader research topics that impact most Plasma designs. 
            </p>
            <br>
    
            <h4 id="cheaper-commitments">Cheaper Commitments</h4>
            <p>
              Plasma contracts make commitments to blocks instead of publishing the full blocks themselves.
              Although this is already much cheaper than using Ethereum directly, it can still get pretty expensive!
            </p>
            <p>
              Most commitments are 32 byte hashes.
              Ethereum transactions currently cost a base fee of 21000 gas, plus an additional 20000 gas for storing the hash.
              That means we're already at <b>41000 gas for a simple commitment</b>, and that doesn't calculate any additional computation costs!
            </p>
            <p>
              If a Plasma chain is publishing a block every 15 seconds, then it's making <b>2102400</b> commitments per year.
              Current gas prices tend to hover at about 2-3 gwei, so that's about <b>100000 USD annually</b> to run a Plasma chain!
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously that's a little unrealistic.
              We already have some tricks to save gas, like only publishing a block once every 6-12 Ethereum blocks (finality time).
              However, there's still plenty of room for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some research has gone into repeatedly reusing Ethereum memory space to make commitments more efficient.
              Check out this post on <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/double-batched-merkle-log-accumulators-for-efficient-plasma-commitments/2313" target="_blank">Merkle Mountain Ranges</a> in Plasma for an example.
              This cuts down the commitment cost by about 50%, but that's still not perfect.

            <ul>
              <li>How can further reduce the gas cost to submit a commitment?</li>
              <li>Can multiple chains coordinate to commit at the same time?</li>
              <li>Can a chain make fewer commitments but retain the same level of security?</li>

            <h4 id="fast-finality">Fast Finality</h4>
            <p> 
              Although most current Plasma implementations significantly increase transaction throughput, they don't improve on finality time.
              In fact, without some additional constructions, we're typically still limited to the finality time of the root chain.
              Ethereum's "safe finality" time is about 6 minutes (25 confirmations or so). 
            </p>
            <p>
              Slow finality isn't acceptable user experience for many applications.
              We shouldn't expect people to sit around for a few minutes just to find out if their transaction went through or not.
              Therefore, we want to find some sort of mechanism that allows for "fast" finality (preferably almost instant).
            </p>
            <p>
              State channels are a well known way to reach fast finality in the context of certain applications.
              However, state channels have their own UX challenges and won't be the right solution for every application.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way to reach some sense of finality is known as "cryptoeconomic" finality.
              Basically, cryptoeconomic finality guarantees that a transaction *will* be included in the chain within some period of time, or someone will cover the full amount.
              In the context of Plasma, this "counterparty" will probably be the operator.
            </p>
            <p>
              A simple example of cryptoeconomic finality might involve a customer making a purchase. 
              We want this transaction to be guaranteed as quickly as possible.
              The merchant might make a deal with the operator that states the operator will include this transaction within some period.
              If the operator doesn't include the transaction, the merchant can take the transaction amount straight from the operator.
              Therefore, the operator is incentivized to include the transaction in a timely manner and the merchant knows they'll get the money either way.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is cool but there are some things that need to be worked out.
              For example, what happens when there isn't a single operator but multiple validators?
              If the validators can't be sure they'll be able to include the transaction, they might not sign these contracts.
              Also, we don't want the counterparty to "overpromise," so we need to make sure each contract is properly backed.
            </p>
            <h6>Research Questions:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Are there other methods for reaching finality?</li>
              <li>Can we make "finality contracts" when we have multiple validators?</li>
              <li>How do we prevent finality counterparties from overpromising?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This is a great research topic for people who are relatively new to Plasma.
              We have lots of different Plasma designs, but not many people have done the important math!
            </p>
            <p>
              So what sort of math still needs to be done?
              Well, it'd be useful, for example, to get a general overview of how much data the average person might have to store in Plasma Cash.
              It would also be useful to model the size of blocks in Plasma MVP.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also really need to know how fast certain signature schemes are to validate!
              It could be that ECDSA isn't the correct choice and that we should use a different scheme.
              These things really just need to be researched and tested.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is a non-exhaustive list of things that would be useful to model.

            <h4 id="zk-snarks">zk-SNARKs</h4>
            <p>
              Zero knowledge succinct arguments of knowledge (or zk-SNARKs) are a relatively recent technological development.
              Basically, they allow us to create certain general purpose programs that can keep information secret.
              Vitalik's <a href="" target="_blank">blog post</a> on zk-SNARKs is a great place to start if you're unfamiliar with how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some work has been done exploring the utility of zk-SNARKs in Plasma.
              For example, it might be possible to create a SNARK circuit that allows the operator to prove they've only included valid transactions in a block.
              This would largely mitigate the need for mass exits in Plasma MVP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, the biggest barrier tends to be proof calculation time.
              Hashes circuits tend to take on the order of a few seconds to compute.
              As a result, it'll probably take on the order of hours to generate a proof that an entire Plasma block is valid.
            </p>
            <p>
              zk-SNARKs have plenty of applications, we just need to find them and figure out which are feasible.
              Lots of research questions still need to be explored!

            <!-- Plasma MVP -->
            <h2 id="plasma-mvp">Plasma MVP</h2>
            <p>
              This is a list of research topics that apply mainly to Plasma MVP.
              Some of this research will be useful to other designs, though! 
            </p>
            <br>
    
            <h4 id="mass-exits">Mass Exits</h4>
            <p>
              Unlike Plasma Cash, the design of Plasma MVP requires that users be able to quickly exit in the case of a safety failure.
              Basically, we need everyone to be able to "exit" the Plasma chain within some short period of time (e.g. one week).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we currently require that every user submit an exit for every single UTXO they own.
              This is not particularly efficient.
              Even a maximally efficient exit will cost at least ~30000 gas (likely much more).
              Assuming (for the sake of argument) that we can take up the entire Ethereum block space for a week, we can process about 10m exits.
            </p>
            <p>
              To put this number in perspective, the current Bitcoin UTXO set is on the order of tens of millions.
              Fortunately, we can make things much more efficient using something called mass exits.
              The basic idea behind mass exits is that we can exit lots and lots of UTXOs at the same time. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One simple way to enable mass exits is to allow users to specify some function that can "aggregate" UTXOs.
              The user can then submit a bitmap (a big string of 0s and 1s) that tells the root chain contract which UTXOs the user is trying to exit (0 = no, 1 = yes).
            </p>
            <p>
              There's still a lot of research to be done determining the most efficient aggregation function.
              One proposed way to do this is to add metadata to each transaction and allow users to aggregate by that metadata.
              This way, large sets of users can exit together.
